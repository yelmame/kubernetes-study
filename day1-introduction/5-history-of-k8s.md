# History of K8S

Kubernetes has a rich history that stems from Google's expertise in managing large-scale containerized applications. Here's a brief timeline of its development:

Origins: Google Borg (2003–2014)
Google had been running containerized applications internally for over a decade using a system called Borg, followed by Omega.

Borg was a large-scale cluster management system that automated the deployment, scaling, and operations of applications across thousands of servers.

It inspired the architecture and design principles of Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is Born (2014)
In June 2014, Google publicly announced Kubernetes as an open-source container orchestration system.

It was heavily influenced by Borg but designed to be open and community-driven.


The name "Kubernetes" comes from the Greek word for "helmsman" or "pilot."

Kubernetes Joins CNCF (2015)
Google donated Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a part of the Linux Foundation.

This move ensured that Kubernetes would be developed in a vendor-neutral, open-source environment.

The first stable release (v1.0) was launched in July 2015.

Rapid Adoption and Growth (2016–2018)
Kubernetes quickly became the standard for container orchestration.

Major cloud providers, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, started offering managed Kubernetes services (EKS, AKS, and GKE).


Maturity and Industry Standardization (2019–Present)
Kubernetes reached enterprise-grade maturity with frequent updates and security improvements.

Technologies like KubeVirt (VMs on Kubernetes), Knative (serverless on Kubernetes), and OpenTelemetry emerged.

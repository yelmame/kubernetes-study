### What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that lets you build, ship, and run applications inside containers.

It solves the "it works on my machine" problem by packaging apps and their dependencies together.

### 📦 What is a Container?
A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that has:

Your application

All libraries, dependencies, and configurations it needs

Containers share the host machine’s OS kernel, but are isolated from each other.

Think of it like a super lightweight virtual machine, but way faster and smaller.

### 🛠️ How Docker Works:
Dockerfile: A text file that defines how to build your application image.

Image: A snapshot of your app and everything it needs.

Container: A running instance of an image.

# Kubernetes Introduction 

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It helps developers and DevOps teams efficiently manage applications that run across multiple hosts, ensuring high availability, scalability, and automation.

### Key Features of Kubernetes

1. Container Orchestration - Manages and coordinates containers (like Docker) across clusters of machines.

2. Automated Scaling - Automatically scales applications up or down based on demand.

3. Self-Healing - Restarts failed containers, replaces unresponsive instances, and reschedules workloads.

4. Load Balancing - Distributes traffic across multiple containers for better performance.

5. Rolling Updates & Rollbacks - Enables seamless application updates without downtime.

6. Storage Orchestration - Supports persistent storage for stateful applications.

7. Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Support - Works across different cloud providers and on-premise environments.

8. Security & Configuration Management - Manages secrets, environment variables, and access controls securely.
